In Java, memory management is handled by the Garbage Collector (GC), and the heap memory is divided into different regions to optimize this process. The primary sections of heap memory are the Young Generation and the Old Generation (also known as Tenured Generation). Within the Young Generation, there are smaller subdivisions called Eden Space and Survivor Spaces. Hereâ€™s an overview:

1. Young Generation (New Generation)
Eden Space:
When a new object is created, it is initially allocated in the Eden Space.
This space is where most objects are allocated and where they are first examined by the garbage collector.
Objects in the Eden Space are short-lived, and many of them are quickly discarded, as most objects in Java applications have a short life span.
Once the Eden Space fills up, a minor GC (Young GC) occurs to free up space by moving surviving objects to the Survivor Spaces.
Survivor Spaces (S0 and S1):
There are typically two Survivor Spaces, S0 (Survivor 0) and S1 (Survivor 1).
After a minor GC, objects that survive from the Eden Space are moved to one of the Survivor Spaces (either S0 or S1).
After subsequent GCs, objects are moved between the Survivor Spaces (from S0 to S1 or vice versa).
If objects survive enough GC cycles (based on the age or tenuring threshold), they are promoted to the Old Generation.

2. Old Generation (Tenured Generation)
Objects that survive multiple GC cycles in the Young Generation are eventually moved to the Old Generation.
The Old Generation holds objects with longer lifetimes, such as cached objects, thread pools, and other objects that are used throughout the application lifecycle.
When the Old Generation becomes full, a major GC (Old GC or Full GC) is triggered, which is generally more expensive than a minor GC because it scans a larger portion of the memory and often leads to application pauses.
Diagram of Heap Memory:

[ Young Generation | Old Generation ]
[ Eden | S0 | S1  |       Old        ]

Key Points:
Eden Space: Where new objects are initially created.
Survivor Spaces (S0, S1): Intermediate spaces for objects that survive a minor GC.
Old Generation: Where objects are moved after surviving many GCs.

Garbage Collection Process:
Objects are allocated in Eden Space.
When Eden fills up, a minor GC occurs.
Surviving objects are moved to a Survivor Space.
Objects that survive multiple GCs are promoted to the Old Generation.
When the Old Generation is full, a major GC happens to clean it up.

how gc happen like internally what is the algorithm?

Java's Garbage Collection (GC) is the process of automatically reclaiming memory by deleting objects that are no longer in use, preventing memory leaks. Internally, various GC algorithms are employed depending on the garbage collector used by the JVM. The algorithms vary based on the garbage collector chosen. Let's break down some of the most commonly used garbage collection algorithms and how they work:

1. Mark-and-Sweep Algorithm
This is the fundamental approach used by many garbage collection strategies. It consists of two phases:

Mark Phase: The GC traverses the object graph starting from the root objects (like active threads, static fields, etc.). It "marks" all objects that are reachable, i.e., still in use.
Sweep Phase: After the marking phase, all objects that were not marked are considered unreachable and thus are eligible for collection. The GC then sweeps through the heap memory and reclaims these objects.
Pros:

Simple and effective for detecting unused objects.
Cons:

Fragmentation: Memory can become fragmented, making it harder to allocate large blocks of memory for new objects.
2. Copying Algorithm (Used for Young Generation)
The copying algorithm is commonly used for garbage collection in the Young Generation. It works by dividing memory into two regions: active and inactive.

The objects are initially allocated in the Eden Space.
When a minor GC occurs, the GC copies all live objects from the active area (Eden) to one of the Survivor Spaces.
Once an object has survived several garbage collection cycles, it is promoted to the Old Generation.
The inactive area is then cleared, and the process repeats.
Pros:

Efficient in memory usage and avoids fragmentation.
Suitable for Young Generation since most objects die young (short-lived).
Cons:

Can be wasteful in terms of copying overhead, especially when objects are large or numerous.
3. Mark-Compact Algorithm (Used for Old Generation)
The Mark-Compact algorithm is an optimization of the Mark-and-Sweep algorithm, primarily used in the Old Generation. It addresses the issue of memory fragmentation.

Mark Phase: Same as in the Mark-and-Sweep algorithm.
Compact Phase: Instead of simply sweeping unreachable objects, the GC compacts the memory by shifting all live objects towards one end of the memory. This leaves one large contiguous block of free space.
Pros:

Prevents memory fragmentation.
Reduces allocation problems for large objects.
Cons:

More expensive in terms of execution time due to the need to move objects.
4. Generational Garbage Collection
Java uses Generational GC to optimize performance based on the observation that most objects "die young." The heap is divided into two primary regions:

Young Generation: Contains newly allocated objects.
Old Generation: Contains long-lived objects.
A minor GC occurs frequently in the Young Generation, while a major GC (Full GC) occurs less frequently in the Old Generation.
How It Works:

New objects are created in the Eden Space.
During a minor GC, surviving objects are moved to the Survivor Spaces.
Objects that survive several GC cycles are promoted to the Old Generation.
When the Old Generation fills up, a major GC happens.
5. Stop-the-World Pause
During a GC event, the JVM may stop the application threads to perform garbage collection, referred to as a Stop-the-World (STW) pause. The length of the pause depends on the GC algorithm being used. Some collectors like Parallel GC and Serial GC have long STW pauses, while G1 GC and ZGC try to minimize these pauses.

6. Garbage Collectors in JVM
Different garbage collectors use different algorithms internally. Here are some of the key garbage collectors provided by the JVM:

a. Serial Garbage Collector
Uses the Mark-and-Sweep and Mark-Compact algorithms.
Single-threaded and designed for applications with small data sets.
Suitable for single-processor machines.
b. Parallel Garbage Collector (Throughput GC)
Uses multiple threads to perform minor and major GCs.
The goal is to maximize application throughput by using more CPU resources during GC.
Uses copying for minor GCs and mark-compact for major GCs.
c. CMS (Concurrent Mark-Sweep) Garbage Collector
Reduces Stop-the-World pauses by performing GC concurrently with the application.
Marking and sweeping phases are concurrent, but the compaction phase is not.
This reduces pause times but can lead to fragmentation.
d. G1 Garbage Collector (Garbage First)
Divides the heap into multiple regions.
Uses both mark-copy and mark-compact strategies.
Tries to minimize pause times by collecting regions with the most garbage first.
Suitable for applications with large heaps.
e. Z Garbage Collector (ZGC)
Low-latency garbage collector that aims to keep pause times below 10 ms, even with large heaps.
Most of the garbage collection happens concurrently with the application threads.
It uses load barriers to reduce GC latency.
High-Level Garbage Collection Flow:
Minor GC: Cleans up objects in the Young Generation (Eden and Survivor Spaces). This is a fast operation because most objects are short-lived.
Major GC (Full GC): Cleans up the Old Generation and usually involves compacting live objects to free up continuous memory space. This process can be more expensive and lead to longer application pauses.
Steps in a Typical GC Cycle:
Initial Mark: Identifies the root objects and marks them as reachable. (Usually involves a Stop-the-World pause)
Concurrent Marking: Traverses the object graph from the roots to mark all reachable objects.
Final Mark (Re-mark): Marks objects that became reachable during the previous marking phase. (Another Stop-the-World pause)
Compaction/Sweeping: Reclaims memory by compacting the heap or sweeping away unreachable objects.
Summary:
Mark-and-Sweep: Marks reachable objects, then reclaims unreachable ones.
Copying: Used in the Young Generation, copies live objects between memory spaces.
Mark-Compact: Combines marking with compacting memory to prevent fragmentation.
Generational GC: Optimizes performance by managing short-lived and long-lived objects separately.
Garbage collectors like G1 and ZGC are designed to optimize performance, reduce pause times, and improve scalability for large heaps and multi-threaded applications.







# how it mark the surviving object like any algorithm avl or something else?

The marking phase of the garbage collection process identifies all the live (reachable) objects in memory. This is typically done through a graph traversal algorithm, which starts from a set of root objects and explores all objects that can be reached from these roots. The marking process does not rely on complex algorithms like AVL trees but rather simpler graph traversal techniques such as Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS).

Steps of the Marking Phase
Start from GC Roots:

The garbage collector starts with a set of root objects (GC roots). These typically include:
Active thread stacks (local variables).
Static variables.
JNI references (objects referenced by native code).
Active thread objects.
Any object directly or indirectly referenced by these roots is considered "alive."
Graph Traversal:

The garbage collector performs a graph traversal starting from the GC roots, following references to objects.

It visits each object and marks it as "live."

The traversal algorithm used is usually Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS).

DFS (Depth-First Search):

The GC explores objects by following one reference chain as far as it can go, then backtracks to explore other paths. This is often implemented using recursion or a stack data structure.
This can be memory-efficient for shallow reference chains.
BFS (Breadth-First Search):

The GC explores all references at the current level before moving deeper. This uses a queue to track objects that need to be visited.
BFS can be useful when objects are connected in a more "horizontal" manner.
Marking Objects:

As the GC traverses, it marks each visited object in some way to indicate that it is "reachable" or "live."
There are different techniques to mark an object:
Mark bit in object header: Some JVMs use a bit in the header of each object to indicate whether it has been marked as live.
Separate data structure: Others use a separate bitmap or table to record whether each object has been visited.
Avoiding Cycles:

Java objects can form circular references. For example, Object A may refer to Object B, and Object B may refer to Object A.
The garbage collector handles this naturally during traversal. Once an object is marked, it is not revisited, so cycles do not cause issues.
Graph Traversal Example:
Consider this object graph:

Object1 references Object2 and Object3.
Object2 references Object4.
Object3 references Object4 (creating a cycle).
The GC would start at Object1 and traverse the object graph:

Mark Object1 as live.
Follow references to Object2 and Object3.
Mark Object2 and Object3 as live.
Continue to Object4, mark it as live.
Detect that Object4 is already marked and avoid revisiting it.
Algorithms Used in Marking:
DFS/BFS: As mentioned, DFS (using recursion or a stack) or BFS (using a queue) is used for the traversal process. Both of these algorithms ensure that all reachable objects are visited.

Tri-color Marking (Used in many modern GCs):

This is an optimization used in concurrent and parallel garbage collectors (such as G1 GC and CMS). The algorithm assigns each object a color to track its state during marking:
White: The object has not yet been visited by the garbage collector and is presumed unreachable.
Gray: The object has been visited, but not all of its children have been visited yet.
Black: The object and all of its references have been fully visited.
The marking phase continues until there are no more gray objects. Afterward, all white objects are considered unreachable and are collected.
Key Points:
Root Set: GC starts from a root set of objects (active threads, static variables, etc.).
Traversal: Uses DFS or BFS to explore object references.
Marking: Each object visited during traversal is marked as live (usually using a mark bit).
Cycle Handling: Naturally managed by marking only unmarked objects, preventing cycles from causing infinite loops.
Tri-Color Marking Example:
Letâ€™s assume the object graph looks like this:


Root -> Object A -> Object B -> Object C
         \-> Object D
Initial state: All objects are white.
The root references Object A, so itâ€™s marked gray.
Object A is processed:
It points to Object B and Object D, so itâ€™s turned black (fully processed), and B and D are marked gray.
Object B is processed:
It references Object C, so B is turned black, and C is marked gray.
Object C is processed:
It has no references, so it turns black.
Object D is processed and turns black as well.
All objects are black, and marking is complete.
Objects that remain white after the marking phase are unreachable and are collected by the garbage collector.

Conclusion:
The marking phase in garbage collection is a graph traversal problem where objects are marked as "live" using simple algorithms like DFS or BFS.
Optimizations such as Tri-color marking ensure that garbage collection can run concurrently with the application, especially in complex, multi-threaded environments.
The final result of the marking phase is that only live objects are marked, while unmarked (unreachable) objects are considered garbage and collected during the sweep or compaction phases.
